Full Simulation
================
After generating the physics processes at the generator level in step 1, a full simulation (detector-level simulation) is applied here. The initial input is in ```.stdhep.gz`` extension which is what is obtained from running the [EventProducer](https://github.com/HEP-FCC/EventProducer#eventproducer) package package and the output is in ```.slcio``` extension which gives the file format of [LCIO](https://github.com/iLCSoft/LCIO) package (Event-Data Model).
